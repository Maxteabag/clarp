# Claude account recovery

When a Claude turn reaches a classified usage limit, the runtime can pause its
Claude turns, activate another saved account, and continue unfinished requests
on their existing native conversation IDs. Configure this separately on each
Host. It is disabled until an account selector is configured.

```toml
[agents]
claude_account_switch_command = ["python3", "/absolute/path/to/account-selector.py"]
```

The selector is a trusted local executable, run without a shell. It receives
`{"models": ["sonnet", "opus"]}` on stdin (an empty model string means the CLI
default). It must activate an account and verify that every requested model can
make a request before returning `{"available": true}` on stdout with exit code
zero. Any other result leaves the turns waiting. Its stdout and stderr are not
logged. It has a five-minute deadline; on POSIX the deadline kills its entire
process group. Keep account credentials in the provider's own credential store.

The local `claude-usage` skill supplies `scripts/auto_switch.py` for installations
using `claude-switch-account` saved profiles. That helper checks saved account
usage, attempts native OAuth refresh when needed, verifies each requested model,
and restores the original profile when no candidate works. Its `--dry-run`
validates stdin without switching accounts or making provider requests.

## Runtime behavior

- Claude's rejected/blocked structured limit event and classified terminal usage
  errors trigger recovery. Allowed/warning events and temporary 429s do not.
- One recovery coordinates all Claude turns owned by the runtime. New turns wait
  behind the recovery barrier; queued follow-ups retain their order. Other
  providers, completed agents, and idle agents receive no continuation.
- The runtime fences the old callbacks, stops the exact owned processes, and
  waits for their transcript drainers before checking accounts. A process that
  will not stop is killed as a group. Remaining owned group members are killed
  and checked with `ps`, including tools that redirected their output. A live
  group member or transcript still draining prevents recovery from advancing.
- A verified account resumes each unfinished request with its original model,
  effort, voice setting, trace, and native conversation ID. The continuation
  instructs the agent to inspect interrupted operations and avoid repeating
  completed work. If the native transcript was never created, Clarp delivers
  the original request as a fresh session using its already assigned ID.
- Recovery does not re-admit the user message. Stop, deletion, or a replacement
  that releases the original turn's ownership prevents automatic continuation.
- New requests parked before their first spawn retain their normal native user
  boundary, even when they resume an agent's older conversation.
- If no account is verified, the runtime keeps the work paused and checks again
  after 60 seconds. Rapid repeated exhaustion also enforces this cooldown. A
  newly arriving model must be verified before the group resumes.
- This covers runtime-dispatched turns. Interactive terminal attachments and
  isolated dreaming subprocesses retain their separate lifecycles.

`claudeAccountRecovery`, `claudeAccountWaiting`, `claudeAccountRecoveryFail`, and
`claudeAccountRecovered` log events explain recovery progress without credentials.
The runtime status includes `claude_account_recovery` with `recovering` and waiting
agent IDs. Waiting agents keep a THINKING state with `account_recovery=waiting`.
The separate runtime service preserves this coordination across HTTP restarts.
Existing runtime startup recovery remains responsible for a runtime/Host crash.

## Verification and rollout

Run focused tests with:

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest -n 2 tests/unit/test_claude_failover.py \
  tests/unit/test_turn_dispatch.py tests/unit/test_clarp_runner.py \
  tests/unit/test_config.py
```

Use fake account selectors and fake providers for exhaustion tests. Do not burn
through a real account's quota or interrupt real work to test the feature.
Deploy through the normal versioned installer. The runtime adopts a new release
at an idle boundary, so check the runtime's release ID as well as HTTP health
before claiming recovery is active. Configure the selector's absolute path on
the Host and verify its executable dependencies are available to the runtime.
