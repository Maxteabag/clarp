# Clarp Sessions

Read the canonical local database through the platform-aware admin command:

```bash
clarp-admin sessions
```

Use the `session` slug for Clarp API requests. Do not guess a session from a
persona when more than one row could match.

## Show or switch a model

An agent can change its own model and effort; with no `--session` the command
targets `$CLAUDE_PWA_SESSION`:

```bash
clarp-admin model                                 # current override + available IDs
clarp-admin model claude-opus-5-5 --effort high   # switch yourself
clarp-admin model sonnet --session lena-1a3f      # switch another agent
clarp-admin model default                         # clear back to the config default
```

Use an exact ID from `available`; do not substitute a model the catalog does
not list. The change applies from the agent's next turn, so the turn that ran
the command keeps its current model. Janitors refuse model changes.

## An agent stays busy with no process

Repair the slot; do not Stop the agent. Stop pauses its queue and goals until
someone resumes them, while a repair interrupts nothing and changes no pause:

```bash
clarp-admin repair --session pebble-2596 --from "$CLAUDE_PWA_SESSION" \
  --reason "busy since 07:25 with no process"
```

`released_trace` is empty when a process, launch, account recovery or Stop
still owns the slot; then the agent is not stuck. Stop only when the work
itself must end: `clarp-admin stop --session X --from "$CLAUDE_PWA_SESSION"
--reason "..."` records you as the actor.

To resume an existing terminal conversation as a Clarp agent, use the
`clarp-adopt` skill.
